A major difference between lists and strings is that lists can be modified while strings cannot.
This is referred to as mutability. Lists are mutable; strings are immutable.

>>> my_list
[1, 3, True, 6.5]
>>> my_list[0]=2**10
>>> my_list
[1024, 3, True, 6.5]
>>> my_name
'David'
>>> my_name[0]='X'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#84>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
